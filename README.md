# cppTetris

A simple Tetris game i worked on near the end of my second year of study using C++ and SFML

# still in progress

A lot of things is still missing, i'm not currently working on this project  
but i still plan to add a lot of things.

it's not yet actually playable because the DAS is missing and it's a key part of the Tetris gameplay but some game modes already exist such as:
- Sprint
- Marathon
- Ultra

tetriminoes sometimes lock too early
